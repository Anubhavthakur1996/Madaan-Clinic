				A small question and a case study

			<p class="section-subtitle">
				<b>Qusetion:</b> Can homeopathy cure sick babies from birth?
			</p>

			<p><b>Answer:</b> Homeopathy is a naturopathy system. If we understand
				the principle of nature and treat it, then we can reduce the intensity of many types of congenital diseases and
				make human being able to lead a normal life in the society. But the question is why does someone get sick from
				birth? And what is this natural law? We all know that this whole world is going on under the laws of nature and
				this rule is the principle of "whatever action one does, he will get the result". There is no doubt about it.
				Under these rules, we get into life and granted mental and physical happiness and sorrow. Now
				when the newborn child has just been born, he/she hasn't performed any actions yet the results of the mother's
				mental state has to be borne by him/her. As a result the child may be a victim of mental and physical disability
				at times.
				But the reality is that it is because of the actions done in the previous birth that we are born before birth.
				Decide
				your life journey by choosing your parents and happiness bears sorrow. In fact, the cause of diseases is not
				physical, nor is disease gross. The defects (Gene)
				received from the parents are also subtle and the disease is also subtle, but the fruit of the disease can be
				first functional and later structural-shaped, accepting these rules 100 percent, it is important to understand
				the disability of a child.</p>

			<p>Got the opportunity A boy, whose age is 15 years, who is being lifted by the arms and dragged by the feet was
				brought, because he was unable to walk and could not even bear the weight of his head, his The fingers of his
				hand
				were also bent. He couldn't even hold anything or lift his weight could.</p>

			<p>On enquiry, it was found that the child was born abnormal, his legs and knees were deformed. The birth weight
				was also very low, reaching the age of 6 months, more symptoms started appearing. His activity was very slow,
				there was less movement, always lying down, looking at the side he was looking at. Its treatment started from
				birth. Due to treatment, he turned 6 years old and now he started having seizures and now his medicine started
				simultaneously and is going on till date. The seizures have reduced but not completely cured. Operation of both
				his knees at the age of 12, it was done so that his legs could be straightened, but the child
				was unable to lift his weight.</p>

			<p>Now the child who is born abnormal since birth, then surely the mother must have had some problem during
				pregnancy. On enquiry, it came to know that the parents did not get along well with each other. The mother also
				did not have good relations with her sister-in-law and there used to be debate in the house. Due to which the
				mother used to get very angry and the blood pressure used to increase. All this was going on from the beginning
				of pregnancy. Due to this, she remained in her maternal home for most of the pregnancy and the child was born
				there.</p>

			<p>Treatment of this child was started on August 2018 but after 2 months he suffered a stroke, but his intensity
				was less and got better sooner than before. After 3 months he had a stroke again, this time also his intensity
				was less, after a few weeks the fingers of his hands started looking a bit straight and now he started trying to
				raise the neck. </p>

			<p>After 5 months, his health started showing even more improvement. Now he started lifting his neck continuously
				and started walking 4-5 steps without support, but bending his waist again during the corona period.</p>

			<p>The child did not get a chance to see face to face, but the medicine continued. One day suddenly a video of him
				came on the mobile, in which he was walking without support in the courtyard of his house, in which he was
				walking leaning after falling. found out on asking that he no longer has seizures.</p>

			<p>Today, after one year of this, the boy is seen walking on the road without support, although he is not able to
				walk straight at all, but stands upright.</p>

			<p>The therapy is going on now, it is expected that in the coming few months, he will be able to walk straight and
				spend his life without being a burden on anyone and with this he will be able to save his life.</p>

			<p>Solving the difficulties himself, one will become a good citizen. In this case, the reason for the
				morphological
				deformity was the anger of the mother at the time of conception. When the organs were forming in the womb, this
				was the time when the mother had to face mental depression. It is not hidden from anyone that the mental state
				of the mother during pregnancy affects the fetus. We all know that Arjuna's son Abhimanyu had learned to break
				the Chakravyuh at the time of pregnancy, he was successful in breaking the Chakravyuh due to this teaching in
				the war of Mahabharata had been.</p>

			<p>
				In solving this case also we adopted the principles of homeopathy of treating the sick rather than treating the
				disease and it was proved that sick is a human being and disease is its reward.
